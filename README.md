# Masters Thesis

This repository will contain all the code used in the simulations and analysis in my masters thesis.

The thesis is written under [Kim Sneppen](https://nbi.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/41236) and [Kunihiko Kaneko](https://nbi.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/440257) at the [Niels Bohr Institute](https://nbi.ku.dk/english/), from August 2023 to June 2024.

## The Topic

The project will involve numerical simulations of critical systems, with a particular focus on systems exhibiting Self-Organized Criticality. 

Possible avenues for exploration include:
* Power-laws in soil
* Power-laws in cell-genomics (and perhaps metabolism too)
* Ubiquity of log-normal distribution in biology
