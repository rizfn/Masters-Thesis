## Meeting 1: 1st September, 2023

Two species of cellular automata: one which is big (2x2) and one which is (1x1)

Both move in a random walk

They move one step each time, and leave holes behind. Holes have a fixed probability to be filled

Big ones kill the small ones when they move in, and have a fixed death rate

Speciaes replicated when they have move from a hole to the soil, as resources are on the boundary.

Rate for death (when moves into a vacant space), rate for birth (when you move into birth), rate for hole filling

Calculate the density and fraction of soil-vacant walls.

Tuesday afternoon: Group meetings

Wednesday 10:30: Guest Lectures


## Meeting 2:

Do a plot of characteristics over time to look for oscillation.

Do it with random connections, and then you can use a mean-field comparison. Compare DEs to the solution.

## Meeting 3:

Logscale x and y

Asymmetry: bacteria ned to live longer than the holes

Check newrepro rate and reset simulation

**Every time step: move all bacteria**: Set a number of bacteria to move every time step, each can move multiple times. One movement per bacteria

Calculate cluster size distribution.

Do log-log axes on heatmap viz

## Meeting 4:

Try to make everything stochastic: choose a point, and depending on what it is, do something (fill/die/move)

If it's a bacteria, check for death, and if not make it move

Do phase space diagram for mean field model
