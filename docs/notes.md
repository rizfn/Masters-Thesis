## Meeting 1: 1st September, 2023

Two species of cellular automata: one which is big (2x2) and one which is (1x1)

Both move in a random walk

They move one step each time, and leave holes behind. Holes have a fixed probability to be filled

Big ones kill the small ones when they move in, and have a fixed death rate

Speciaes replicated when they have move from a hole to the soil, as resources are on the boundary.

Rate for death (when moves into a vacant space), rate for birth (when you move into birth), rate for hole filling

Calculate the density and fraction of soil-vacant walls.

Tuesday afternoon: Group meetings

Wednesday 10:30: Guest Lectures
